## 1 - Installation

#### Through npm

```bash
> npm i -D klonex
```

(which is exactly the same as `npm install --save-dev klonex`)

#### Through yarn

If you're not an npm user, you could use yarn:

```bash
> yarn add -D klonex
```

The reality is that KlonexJS is a development package; it is meant to help you locally.
That's why we recommend you to install it as a dev dependency.

## 2 - What's next?

On the 1st of October, the 1st stable version of KlonexJS will
be released. It is going to be a game changer in web
development!

In the following weeks, many updates will be added to this
README file, so, stay tuned...
